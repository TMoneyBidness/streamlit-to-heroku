    "# Zero-Coupon Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will calculate the present value of a zero-coupon bond from its future value, and compare the resulting present value to its selling price in order to determine whether or not the bond is worth purchasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A zero-coupon bond is a debt security that does not pay interest (a coupon) as an annual cash flow; instead, it simply distributes a lump sum, or its face value, upon bond maturity (when the bond completes its duration). Zero-coupon bonds trade at a discount to their future value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [starter file](Unsolved/zero_coupon_bonds.py), walk through the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a function named `calculate_present_value` that executes the present value formula in Python. Make sure the function has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `future_value`: This is equivalent to the face value, or maturity value, of bonds; a lump sum given at the end of the duration of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `discount_rate`: This is the rate of return over the duration of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `compounding_periods`: Assumed to be equal to 1 for bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `years`: The number of years constituting the duration of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass the bond parameters into the `calculate_present_value` function and return the value to a variable `bond_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the `bond_value` to its `price` and determine if the bond is worth purchasing or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the bond is selling at a `discount`, purchase the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Else if the bond is selling at a `premium`, do not purchase the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Else the bond is selling at its fair market value, you're neutral to the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't overthink it! We are simply calculating the present value of a future value! \n",
    "\n",
    "The present value formula is:  `PV = FV / (1 + (i/ n) ^ (n x t))`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `PV = $15,000 / (1 + (10% / 1) ^ (1 x 1)) = $13,636`\n",
